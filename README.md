# CornerGrocerItemTracker

## Project Summary
The **CornerGrocerItemTracker** project is a C++ application that solves the problem of tracking grocery items sold at a store. It processes a list of items sold during the day, counts how many times each item was sold, and generates a report displaying this information. The program allows users to search for a specific item to view how often it was sold and outputs the sales report to a file. The project simulates a small-scale inventory management system for a grocery store, showcasing fundamental programming skills in C++.

## What I Did Particularly Well
I implemented the file input/output handling in a way that efficiently reads and processes large datasets of items. The program ensures accuracy when counting item occurrences and outputs the data in a structured format. I was also able to create well-documented code that is easy to follow and understand, which would be essential for future users or developers who want to build on this project.

## Potential Enhancements
While the project works well for basic item tracking, it could be improved by adding more robust error handling for cases like invalid user input or missing data files. Additionally, implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) could make the application more user-friendly and accessible for non-technical users. Adding encryption for file data could also increase security when handling sensitive information.

## Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging aspect of the project was designing the logic to efficiently read and process item data from large input files. Initially, I struggled with slow performance for large datasets, but after researching and applying buffered file reading techniques, the performance improved significantly. I used resources like C++ documentation and StackOverflow to guide my implementation.

## Transferable Skills
This project helped me develop skills in object-oriented programming, file handling, and algorithm optimization. These skills are transferable to other projects, especially when working with data structures and memory management in C++.

## Maintainability and Readability
To ensure the program is maintainable, I used modular functions to separate different tasks, such as file reading, item counting, and report generation. Each function is clearly documented, and meaningful variable names were used throughout the code. This approach ensures that future modifications or enhancements can be made with minimal effort.
