CornerGrocerItemTracker
Project Summary
The CornerGrocerItemTracker project is a C++ application that solves the problem of tracking grocery items sold at a store. It processes a list of items sold during the day, counts how many times each item was sold, and generates a report displaying this information. The program allows users to search for a specific item to view how often it was sold and outputs the sales report to a file. The project simulates a small-scale inventory management system for a grocery store, showcasing fundamental programming skills in C++.

What I Did Particularly Well
I implemented the file input/output handling in a way that efficiently reads and processes large datasets of items. The program ensures accuracy when counting item occurrences and outputs the data in a structured format. I was also able to create well-documented code that is easy to follow and understand, which would be essential for future users or developers who want to build on this project.

Potential Enhancements
While the project works well for basic item tracking, it could be improved by adding more robust error handling for cases like invalid user input or missing data files. Additionally, implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) could make the application more user-friendly and accessible for non-technical users. Adding encryption for file data could also increase security when handling sensitive information.

Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging aspect of the project was designing the logic to efficiently read and process item data from large input files. Initially, I struggled with slow performance for large datasets. To overcome this, I researched C++ file handling best practices and implemented buffered reading to optimize the program's speed. I also used a map data structure to quickly count item occurrences, which significantly improved performance.

To further support my development, I relied on online resources such as C++ documentation, StackOverflow, and code examples from past assignments.

Transferable Skills
The skills I developed through this project—particularly in object-oriented programming, file handling, and algorithm optimization—are highly transferable to other projects. Working with data structures, memory management, and secure file handling in C++ are valuable skills that I can apply to future coursework or real-world development tasks.

Program Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To make the program maintainable and adaptable, I used clear and descriptive variable names, and wrote modular functions to separate each task (such as file reading, item counting, and report generation). I included detailed comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each function and its parameters. This modular structure ensures that the program can be easily updated in the future, whether it’s adding new features like additional report formats or integrating the program with other systems.
